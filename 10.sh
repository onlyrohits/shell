# Write script to print given numbers sum of all digit, For eg. If no is 123 it's sum of all digit will be 1+2+3 = 6.
# Algo:
#       1) Input number n
#       2) Set sum=0, sd=0
#   	3) Find single digit in sd as n % 10 it will give (left most digit)
#       4) Construct sum no as sum=sum+sd
#       5) Decrment n by 1
#       6) Is n is greater than zero, if yes goto step 3, otherwise next step
#       7) Print sum
